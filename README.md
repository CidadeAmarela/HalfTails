# HalfTails

Half of requirements, half of needs of the [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) system [Live USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB). 

## Objectives

It is only a *documentation project*,  "plug-and-play" sequence of instructions to cretate secure (the most secure and reliable possible!) Live USB using:

* standard Linux: *minimal* [Debian Stable](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable)
* Live USB basic or persistent options
* Mozilla Firefox and other basic tools as Tails reccomendations, but **without** [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).
* Updates, care, etc. as Tails reccomendations, but without Tor.
